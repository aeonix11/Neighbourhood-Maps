# Udacity Neighbourhood Maps Project
-------------------------------------

The Neighbourhood Maps Project is a project made to teach you about using multiple API's together in your
project.I used Google maps, Google streetview and Foursquare.

Foursquare provides you with info on a certain location like address, telephone number or tips.

* My project has a map and a sidebar with a searchbar and a list on it.
* You can search for locations in the searchbar and it will filter the list for you.
* If you click on the items in the list it will move the screen to center on the location
you clicked on. It well then open an infowindow with a streetview and foursquare data.
* You can also click on the icons on the map to see their infowindows.
* If you remove you text from the searchbar the screen will recenter on the map in a way that you
can see all the locations.
* The app is also responsive so you can view it on multiple devices.
* Also if the screen is small then the map gets zoomed further out.
